# C-Reflection-of-Classes
this program runs a DLL file to check the classes  and arranges them differently
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Data structures used for this Programme is both premitive and non premitive data:
 
the data types that  i have used are  Strings, 
because a string is used to save the name of the classes, 
the methods and other wording data, externaal references

the other datatype that i have used is an integer,
which is used to count the number of method, 
number of classes, number of avegrage lines and other calculations 

i have also used a list , 
the list is used to add data and 
the list enables me to be able to sort the data in alphabetical order or 
some or other form asceding or decending

for me to be able to display all the data from the data structures, i used a datagridview,
because it hase a proper listed view for the data
i also used a textbox fir user prompt information
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The TestDtata.dll file 

the testdata is about what we view on television,
movies, series and tvShows

i chose to use this Dll file because it has atleast has 3 classes and the classes display 
a different number of average lines from a method,

 this then shows the accuracy of the data that we are using to test this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
to complile and run the programme and how to use the programme.

download Visual studio 2017 with a dot.net package
open the programme using Visual studio 

click the run button on visual studio

load the test.dll file using the load button to dynamically load the file 

the loaded file will then display the reflection of the dll file

with the methods in the dll file, you can filter the information by 
limiting the min amount of average lines on the methods using the user promp option

the reflection will show
the claases and the number of methods in the class,
the methods and the average lines in a method
the external references in the programme

you can then filter the methods displayed by entering a limiting factor.
